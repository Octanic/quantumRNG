# QuantumRNG
Random Number Generator using Quantum Computing

## What is it?
Random numbers are not entirely random if we think about our daily computing. Because random numbers are based on our system clock.

In a quantum environment, a bit (I mean *qubit*), can have both `0` and `1` - at the same time! Until it is analyzed.

## How can I run it?
First, you have to install QDK from Microsoft, downloading it for VSCode:

Next, open the project in VSCode and run it in your terminal by doing
```
dotnet run
```

## Disclaimer
I'm no quantum scientist. I know enough to have some superficial conversation and have some crazy thoughts about it. I like the topic. üòÅ
Also, I did this with by doing this introduction module from Microsoft Learn:
